            What programming languages are most often used in your project?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In the field of web development, there are various technologies and
            programming languages. Typically, this includes a combination of
            frontend (client side) and backend (server side) languages.

          <h3>What are the deadlines for the project?</h3>
          <p>

            and the availability of resources. Determining exact deadlines is a
            difficult task, and it usually occurs during the planning phase of
            the project.
